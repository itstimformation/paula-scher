  Paula Scher is a multi-award winning designer whose career has spanned over
  four decades. She is well-known for her environmental graphics, work as an
  educator, and her work at the world’s largest design consultancy, Pentagram.
  When she was just five years old she remembers seeing an abstract cover for
  South Pacific and this made her curious about design. However, with no
  artists in her family, Scher didn’t truly ‘find’ herself until she discovered
  a graphic design course. From making paper dolls and comic strips in
  school, to serving on the Art Commission for the city of New York, Scher
  has made a huge impact through her work and life.

<h2>Early Life</h2>
<p>
  On October 6 1948, Paula Scher was born in Washington DC, Virginia. Growing
  up as a child she moved house numerous times, from DC to Arlington, then
  Fairfax County, before finally settling in Silver Spring, Maryland where she
  attended Silver Spring Elementary School. Scher found it hard growing up in
  a family and had an unhappy childhood, one where no one had the same passion
  for art as she did. She would draw a lot and used this as a way to go off
  to her room and escape everyone else. As a result this hindered the
  relationship she had with her parents for her child years. While at home,
  Schers father was a photogrammetric engineer who worked for the US
  Geological Survey. The USGS study the landscape of the USA and also look
  at any natural hazards that could have a negative effect on the country.
  During his time working there, he developed a device known as Stereo
  Templates in the basement of the family home. This basically corrected any
  lens distortion that took place in aerial photography. This allowed the
  government to create more accurate maps of the country and has played a
  major part in the development of Google Maps. After this huge
  development, he gave his invention to the Government for a mere $1500.

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>
  Scher attended high school in Silver Springs and while there she also
  attended additional art classes at Corcoran College of Art and Design. Due
  to her obvious talent and passion, she ended up being the high schools
  publicity chairman and created all the posters and advertising for all the
  school events, she was nicknamed ‘the school artist’. In a recent interview
  Scher laughed as she described how she created the posters for all the
  events she never attended.
</p>

<p>
  In 1966, during the time of the Vietnam War, Scher attended Tyler School of
  Art in Pennsylvania. She originally wanted to draw however quickly found out
  that she couldn’t draw overly well. Scher tried many different things before
  discovering graphic design in her junior year.
</p>

<blockquote class="works">
  <p>
    “Helvetica is the font of the Vietnam War”
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  The first year of graphic design was taught in the Basel method which
  required you to be net in your work, however Scher admitted to having a lack
  of neatness skills and this idea made her feel like she was being forced to
  “tidy her room”. She found that her ideas were much stronger than her ability
  to draw. All of this made the decision for her to switch major in design.
  In doing so she had classes with Stephen Tarantal. His classes focused on
  ideas. But, when the course split, she chose illustration. It was during
  this time that Scher met one of her mentors who would influence the rest
  of her life as a designer.  Stanislaw Zagorski’s classes combined both
  illustration and design where Scher had always solved problems
  illustratively. Stanislaw told her during his classes, “illustrate with
  type”. To this day, Scher says that this was the best advice she had
  received and immediately began to illustrate through the use of type. A
  lot of her education was rooted in the Swiss international style of
  typography.
</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “Words have meaning, type has spirit”
    </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
  In 1970, Paula Scher graduated Tyler School of Art with a Bachelor of Fine
  Arts and mentors that would inspire her for a lifetime.

</p>

<article class="career" id="career">
<h2>Career</h2>
<p>
  After graduating with a BFA, Scher moved to New York City carrying with her
  no more than $50 and her portfolio. She spent two years living in different
  suburbs with numerous friends. This experience inspired her to write her
  later children’s book ‘The Brownstone’. Her first job she got was designing
  the insides of children’s books for Random House after meeting the Art
  Director, Harris Lewine. Through this connection, Scher met her future
  husband, Seymour Chwast who at the time was an established partner at Push
  Pin Studios. They married in 1973 but were divorced five years later.
  However, after having some “time off for bad behaviour”, they remarried
  in 1989.
</p>

<blockquote class="works">
  <p>
    “I wasn't a very good illustrator so I became a designer.”
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  In 1972 Scher got a job within the promotions department at CBS records all
  the time wanting to work in the record over department as those artists were
  considered ‘better’. After working in promotions for two years, she made a
  move to Atlantic records as an art director. After just a year gaining
  experience, Scher moved back to CBS as an art director and ended up working
  there for 8 years and was credited for designing upwards of 150 covers a
  year. Aside from her covers, she was credited with reviving numerous
  historical typefaces and design styles. When creating album covers, Scher
  found she preferred to use a mood or mysterious scenario over a literal
  description of artists. The economic crash during the 1970’s had a large
  impact on her mature work. The crash pushed her to rely much more heavily
  on letterforms over illustrations and portray content and identity via
  typography. In later years, this style became her hallmark.
</p>

<p>
  Scher approached her work from what she called a populist viewpoint. This
  encompasses both popular culture with the goal of engaging people with the
  cover art in order to interest them enough to buy the record.
</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “That early foundation was very important in solidifying how I think about
      things, even though styles and technologies have changed”
    </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
  In 1982, Scher left the record industry in order to pursue a new career of her
  own company, partnered with her old school friend, Terry Koppel who at the
  time was a popular magazine designer. The studios of Koppel and Scher was a
  balance of editorial design along with promotion packaging and covers. The
  company lasted for about 7 years until the first Gulf War hit in 1990 along
  with a recession. This economic downturn meant for Scher and Koppel, there
  were no magazines to design. Terry Koppel moved to esquire and left Scher to
  run the business.
</p>

<p>
  In 1991 Woody Pirtle, a partner at Pentagram Design Consultancy, came to
  Scher’s studio and approached her about joining Pentagram. From there, Scher
  became a Principal at the New York City offices.
</p>

<p>
  In 1992, Scher also became an educator when she began teaching at the
  School of Visual Arts in New York City. As well as this Scher taught in Cooper
  Union. Yale University, and returned to Tyler School of Arts.
</p>

<blockquote class="works">
  <p>
    “My mother made me get my teaching certificate so there would be something to fall back on.”
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Scher has won more than 300 awards from many international design associations.
  She is a select member of AGI – Alliance Graphique Internationale and her
  work is featured in collections within MoMA, the Library of Congress, Museum
  Für Gestaltung, and the Centre George Pompidou.
