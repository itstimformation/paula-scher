  Paula Scher is a multi-award winning designer whose career has spanned over
  four decades. She is well-known for her environmental graphics, work as an
  educator, and her work at the world’s largest design consultancy, Pentagram.
  When she was just five years old she remembers seeing an abstract cover for
  South Pacific and this made her curious about design. However, with no
  artists in her family, Scher didn’t truly ‘find’ herself until she discovered
  a graphic design course. From making paper dolls and comic strips in
  school, to serving on the Art Commission for the city of New York, Scher
  has made a huge impact through her work and life.

<h2>Early Life</h2>
<p>
  On October 6 1948, Paula Scher was born in Washington DC, Virginia. Growing
  up as a child she moved house numerous times, from DC to Arlington, then
  Fairfax County, before finally settling in Silver Spring, Maryland where she
  attended Silver Spring Elementary School. Scher found it hard growing up in
  a family and had an unhappy childhood, one where no one had the same passion
  for art as she did. She would draw a lot and used this as a way to go off
  to her room and escape everyone else. As a result this hindered the
  relationship she had with her parents for her child years. While at home,
  Schers father was a photogrammetric engineer who worked for the US
  Geological Survey. The USGS study the landscape of the USA and also look
  at any natural hazards that could have a negative effect on the country.
  During his time working there, he developed a device known as Stereo
  Templates in the basement of the family home. This basically corrected any
  lens distortion that took place in aerial photography. This allowed the
  government to create more accurate maps of the country and has played a
  major part in the development of Google Maps. After this huge
  development, he gave his invention to the Government for a mere $1500.

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>
  Scher attended high school in Silver Springs and while there she also
  attended additional art classes at Corcoran College of Art and Design. Due
  to her obvious talent and passion, she ended up being the high schools
  publicity chairman and created all the posters and advertising for all the
  school events, she was nicknamed ‘the school artist’. In a recent interview
  Scher laughed as she described how she created the posters for all the
  events she never attended.

  In 1966, during the time of the Vietnam War, Scher attended Tyler School of
  Art in Pennsylvania. She originally wanted to draw however quickly found out
  that she couldn’t draw overly well. Scher tried many different things before
  discovering graphic design in her junior year.

  The first year of graphic design was taught in the Basel method which
  required you to be net in your work, however Scher admitted to having a lack
  of neatness skills and this idea made her feel like she was being forced to
  “tidy her room”. She found that her ideas were much stronger than her ability
  to draw. All of this made the decision for her to switch major in design.
  In doing so she had classes with Stephen Tarantal. His classes focused on
  ideas. But, when the course split, she chose illustration. It was during
  this time that Scher met one of her mentors who would influence the rest
  of her life as a designer.  Stanislaw Zagorski’s classes combined both
  illustration and design where Scher had always solved problems
  illustratively. Stanislaw told her during his classes, “illustrate with
  type”. To this day, Scher says that this was the best advice she had
  received and immediately began to illustrate through the use of type. A
  lot of her education was rooted in the Swiss international style of
  typography.

  In 1970, Paula Scher graduated Tyler School of Art with a Bachelor of Fine
  Arts and mentors that would inspire her for a lifetime.
